## LED-Matrix

Resistors should be determined to equal brightness impression.
For my LEDs these are the values:

|Color    | night | day |
| ---     | ---   | --- |
| red                 |               |                 |
| green               |               |                 |
| blue                |               |                 |
| magenta             | 40kOhm (60µA) | 428 Ohm (4,9mA) |
| warm-white (yellow) | 82kOhm (34µA) | 857 Ohm (2,8mA) |
| ice-blue (cyan)     | 60kOhm        | 450 Ohm (4,4mA) |
